        <h2>Why go ‘wild’ swimming</h2>
        <p>There is something slightly naughty, a little bit scary and wonderfully
            invigorating about leaving your wetsuit at home, and entering open water
            with just your skin (and perhaps a swimming costume) between you and the
            elements.Freed from the thermal and neoprene protection of a wetsuit,
            cold water immersion provides a sense of elation and relaxation, soothes
            muscle aches, relieves depression and boosts the immune system. It’s also a
            antastically convenient way to explore the countryside, with no kit to lug
            around. The health and psychological benefits of dipping in natural waters
            have been long known. George Bernard Shaw, Benjamin Britten, Charles Darwin
            and Florence Nightingale were all advocates of regular cold baths to
            strengthen the mental constitution and physical state. And all wild-dippers
            know the natural endorphin high that raises mood, elates the senses and
            creates an addictive urge to dive back in, and sets the day off to a
            fantastic start. The vaso dilation in the extremities also pumps out toxin,
            and the cold water starts a process of cold adaptation, which quickly builds
            your cold tolerance, make cold water feel more comfortable, and your body more
            healthy.
